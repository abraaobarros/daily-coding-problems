## It should be one initiative to learn C++ focused on Competitive programming

# Learn basic of language
- Input, output
- Compile a program
- Implement basics algorithms of sorting, queue and stack
- Use pointers to build tree and graphs
- Start to solve easy problems from leetcode in C++

# Plan to algorithms catchup
- Binary search
- String transverse
- Tree transverse
- Graph transverse

## How run the codes

compile
``` bash
#any warn visible
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall <code> -o <file>;
```
execute
``` bash
./<file>
```
